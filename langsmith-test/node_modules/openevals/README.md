# ⚖️ OpenEvals

Much like tests in traditional software, evals are an important part of bringing LLM applications to production.
The goal of this package is to help provide a starting point for you to write evals for your LLM applications, from which
you can write more custom evals specific to your application.

If you are looking for evals specific to evaluating LLM agents, please check out [`agentevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals).

# Quickstart

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to follow along with a video walkthrough, click the image below:
> [![Video quickstart](https://img.youtube.com/vi/J-F30jRyhoA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-F30jRyhoA)

To get started, install `openevals`:

```bash
npm install openevals @langchain/core
```

This quickstart will use an evaluator powered by OpenAI's `gpt-5.4` model to judge your results, so you'll need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

Once you've done this, you can run your first eval:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, CONCISENESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const concisenessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  // CONCISENESS_PROMPT is just an f-string
  prompt: CONCISENESS_PROMPT,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const inputs = "How is the weather in San Francisco?"
// These are fake outputs, in reality you would run your LLM-based system to get real outputs
const outputs = "Thanks for asking! The current weather in San Francisco is sunny and 90 degrees."

// When calling an LLM-as-judge evaluator, parameters are formatted directly into the prompt
const evalResult = await concisenessEvaluator({
  inputs,
  outputs,
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    key: 'score',
    score: false,
    comment: 'The output includes an unnecessary greeting ("Thanks for asking!") and extra..'
}
```

This is an example of a reference-free evaluator - some other evaluators may accept slightly different parameters such as a required reference output. LLM-as-judge evaluators will attempt to format any passed parameters into their passed `prompt`, allowing you to flexibly customize criteria or add other fields.

See the [LLM-as-judge](#llm-as-judge) section for more information on how to customize the [scoring](#customizing-output-score-values) to output float values rather than just `True/False`, the [model](#customizing-the-model), or the [prompt](#customizing-prompts)!

# Installation

You can install `openevals` like this:

```bash
npm install openevals @langchain/core
```

For LLM-as-judge evaluators, you will also need an LLM client. By default, `openevals` will use [LangChain chat model integrations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) and comes with `langchain_openai` installed by default. However, if you prefer, you may use the OpenAI client directly:

```bash
npm install openai
```

It is also helpful to be familiar with some [evaluation concepts](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/evaluation-concepts).

# Evaluators

## LLM-as-judge

One common way to evaluate an LLM app's outputs is to use another LLM as a judge. This is generally a good starting point for evals.

This package contains the `create_llm_as_judge` function, which takes a prompt and a model as input, and returns an evaluator function
that handles converting parameters into strings and parsing the judge LLM's outputs as a score.

To use the `create_llm_as_judge` function, you need to provide a prompt and a model. OpenEvals includes many prebuilt prompts for common evaluation scenarios — see the [Prebuilt prompts](#prebuilt-prompts) section for a full list. Here's an example:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const correctnessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});
```

Note that `CORRECTNESS_PROMPT` is a simple f-string that you can log and edit as needed for your specific use case:

```ts
console.log(CORRECTNESS_PROMPT);
```

```
You are an expert data labeler evaluating model outputs for correctness. Your task is to assign a score based on the following rubric:

<Rubric>
  A correct answer:
  - Provides accurate and complete information
  ...
<input>
{inputs}
</input>

<output>
{outputs}
</output>
...
```

By convention, we generally suggest sticking to `inputs`, `outputs`, and `reference_outputs` as the names of the parameters for LLM-as-judge evaluators, but these will be directly formatted into the prompt so you can use any variable names you want.


OpenEvals includes prebuilt prompts for common evaluation scenarios. See the [Prebuilt prompts](#prebuilt-prompts) section for a full list organized by category.

### Customizing prompts

The `prompt` parameter for `create_llm_as_judge` may be an f-string, [LangChain prompt template](#customizing-with-langchain-prompt-templates), or a function that takes kwargs and returns a list of formatted messages.

Though we suggest sticking to conventional names (`inputs`, `outputs`, and `reference_outputs`) as prompt variables, your prompts can also require additional variables. You would then pass these extra variables when calling your evaluator function. Here's an example of a prompt that requires an extra variable named `context`:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge } from "openevals";

const MY_CUSTOM_PROMPT = `
Use the following context to help you evaluate for hallucinations in the output:

<context>
{context}
</context>

<input>
{inputs}
</input>

<output>
{outputs}
</output>
`;

const customPromptEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: MY_CUSTOM_PROMPT,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const inputs = "What color is the sky?"
const outputs = "The sky is red."

const evalResult = await customPromptEvaluator({
  inputs,
  outputs,
});
```

The following options are also available for string prompts:

- `system`: a string that sets a system prompt for the judge model by adding a `system` message before other parts of the prompt.
- `few_shot_examples`: a list of example dicts that are appended to the end of the prompt. This is useful for providing the judge model with examples of good and bad outputs. The required structure looks like this:

```ts
const fewShotExamples = [
    {
        inputs: "What color is the sky?",
        outputs: "The sky is red.",
        reasoning: "The sky is red because it is early evening.",
        score: 1,
    }
]
```

These will be appended to the end of the final user message in the prompt.

#### Customizing with LangChain prompt templates

You can also pass a [LangChain prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/prompt_templates/) if you want more control over formatting. Here's an example that uses mustache formatting instead of f-strings:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge } from "openevals";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const inputs = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const outputs = { a: 1, b: 2 };

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", "You are an expert at determining if two objects are equal."],
  ["user", "Are these two equal? {{inputs}} {{outputs}}"],
], { templateFormat: "mustache" });

const evaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
  feedbackKey: "equality",
});

const result = await evaluator({ inputs, outputs });
```

```
{
    key: 'equality',
    score: true,
    comment: '...'
}
```

You can also pass in a function that takes your LLM-as-judge inputs as kwargs and returns formatted chat messages.

### Customizing the model

There are a few ways you can customize the model used for evaluation. You can pass a string formatted as `PROVIDER:MODEL` (e.g. `model=anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`) as the `model`, in which case the package will [attempt to import and initialize a LangChain chat model instance](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chat_models_universal_init/). This requires you to install the appropriate LangChain integration package installed. Here's an example:

```bash
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const anthropicEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  model: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
});
```

You can also directly pass a LangChain chat model instance as `judge`. Note that your chosen model must support [structured output](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/):

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const anthropicEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  judge: new ChatAnthropic({ model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest", temperature: 0.5 }),
});
```

This is useful in scenarios where you need to initialize your model with specific parameters, such as `temperature` or alternate URLs if using models through a service like Azure.

Finally, you can pass a model name as `model` and a `judge` parameter set to an OpenAI client instance:

```bash
npm install openai
```

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const openaiEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  model: "gpt-5.4",
  judge: new OpenAI(),
});
```

### Customizing output score values

There are two fields you can set to customize the outputted scores of your evaluator:

- `continuous`: a boolean that sets whether the evaluator should return a float score somewhere between 0 and 1 instead of a binary score. Defaults to `False`.
- `choices`: a list of floats that sets the possible scores for the evaluator.

These parameters are mutually exclusive. When using either of them, you should make sure that your prompt is grounded in information on what specific scores mean - the prebuilt ones in this repo do not have this information!

For example, here's an example of how to define a less harsh definition of correctness that only penalizes incorrect answers by 50% if they are on-topic:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge } from "openevals";

const MY_CUSTOM_PROMPT = `
You are an expert data labeler evaluating model outputs for correctness. Your task is to assign a score based on the following rubric:

<Rubric>
  Assign a score of 0, .5, or 1 based on the following criteria:
  - 0: The answer is incorrect and does not mention doodads
  - 0.5: The answer mentions doodads but is otherwise incorrect
  - 1: The answer is correct and mentions doodads
</Rubric>

<input>
{inputs}
</input>

<output>
{outputs}
</output>

<reference_outputs>
{reference_outputs}
</reference_outputs>
`;

const customEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: MY_CUSTOM_PROMPT,
  choices: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0],
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const result = await customEvaluator({
  inputs: "What is the current price of doodads?",
  outputs: "The price of doodads is $10.",
  reference_outputs: "The price of doodads is $15.",
});

console.log(result);
```

```
{
    'key': 'score',
    'score': 0.5,
    'comment': 'The provided answer mentioned doodads but was incorrect.'
}
```

Finally, if you would like to disable justifications for a given score, you can set `use_reasoning=False` when creating your evaluator.

### Customizing output schema

If you need to change the structure of the raw output generated by the LLM, you can also pass a custom output schema into your LLM-as-judge evaluator as `output_schema` (Python) / `outputSchema` (TypeScript). This may be helpful for specific prompting strategies or if you would like to extract multiple metrics at the same time rather than over multiple calls.

> [!CAUTION]
> Passing `output_schema` changes the return value of the evaluator to match the passed `output_schema` value instead of the typical OpenEvals format.
> We recommend sticking with the default schema if you do not specifically need additional properties.

For Python, `output_schema` may be:

- A `TypedDict` instance
- A [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) model
- [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)
- [OpenAI's structured output format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=chat#supported-schemas)

For TypeScript, `outputSchema` may be:

- A [Zod](https://zod.dev) object
- [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)
- [OpenAI's structured output format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=chat#supported-schemas)

Note that if you are using an OpenAI client directly, only JSON schema and OpenAI's structured output format.

Here's an example:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

import { createLLMAsJudge } from "openevals";

const equalitySchema = z.object({
  equality_justification: z.string(),
  are_equal: z.boolean(),
})

const inputs = "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.";
const outputs = "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.";

const llmAsJudge = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: "Are the following two values equal? {inputs} {outputs}",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
  outputSchema: equalitySchema,
});

const evalResult = await llmAsJudge({ inputs, outputs });

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    'equality_justification': 'The values are equal because they have the same properties with identical values.',
    'are_equal': True,
}
```

#### Logging feedback with custom output schemas

If you are using an OpenEvals evaluator with [LangSmith's `pytest` or `Vitest`/`Jest` runners](#pytest-or-vitestjest), you will need to manually [log feedback keys](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/pytest#log-feedback).

If you are using `evaluate`, you will need to wrap your evaluator in another function that maps your evaluator return value to [feedback in the right format](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/code-evaluator).

#### Structured prompts

Passing in a pulled prompt from the [LangChain prompt hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) that has an output schema set will also change the output schema for the LLM-as-judge evaluator.

### Multimodal

LLM-as-judge evaluators support multimodal inputs including images, audio, and PDFs. There are two ways to pass multimodal content:

- **`attachments` parameter** — include an `{attachments}` placeholder in your prompt and pass the content via the `attachments` kwarg.
- **LangChain prompt template** — introduce multimodal content directly into the prompt message. See the [LangChain multimodal messages docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal) for details.

#### Option 1: `attachments` parameter

The `attachments` parameter supports a single dict or a list of dicts with a `mime_type` and base64-encoded `data` field. The prebuilt [Image](#image) and [Voice](#voice) prompts already include the `{attachments}` placeholder, or you can add it to any custom prompt.

Supported attachment types:

| Type | `mime_type` |
|------|-------------|
| Images | `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` |
| Audio | `audio/wav`, `audio/mp3`, `audio/mpeg` |
| PDF | `application/pdf` |

> [!NOTE]
> Multimodal support depends on your model provider. Audio input and structured output (e.g. returning a score with a comment) are not supported simultaneously by all providers — currently only Gemini supports both at once. The prebuilt [Voice](#voice) prompts use `google-genai:gemini-2.0-flash` for this reason.

Passing a URL string directly as `attachments` is supported for images only. Audio and PDF attachments must be passed as a base64-encoded data URI with `mime_type` and `data` fields.

Here's an example using the prebuilt `IMAGE_RELEVANCE_PROMPT`. You can pass an image as a URL or as a base64-encoded data URI — both work the same way:

```ts
import * as fs from "fs";
import { createLLMAsJudge, IMAGE_RELEVANCE_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const evaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: IMAGE_RELEVANCE_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "image_relevance",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

// Option A: pass a URL string directly
const evalResult = await evaluator({
  inputs: "Show me a picture of fruits",
  outputs: "Here is an image of various fruits",
  attachments: "https://example.com/fruits.jpg",
});

// Option B: pass a base64-encoded data URI
const imageData = "data:image/jpeg;base64," + fs.readFileSync("image.jpg").toString("base64");

const evalResultB64 = await evaluator({
  inputs: "Show me a picture of fruits",
  outputs: "Here is an image of various fruits",
  attachments: { mime_type: "image/jpeg", data: imageData },
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    key: 'image_relevance',
    score: true,
    comment: '...'
}
```

#### Option 2: LangChain prompt template

You can also introduce multimodal content into the prompt using a LangChain prompt template. See the [LangChain multimodal messages docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal) for details.

## Prebuilt prompts

OpenEvals includes prebuilt prompts for common evaluation scenarios that work out of the box with [`create_llm_as_judge`](#llm-as-judge). All prebuilt prompts are importable from `openevals.prompts`.

### Quality

These prompts evaluate general output quality.

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `CONCISENESS_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Whether the output is appropriately brief and avoids unnecessary padding |
| `CORRECTNESS_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `reference_outputs` (optional) | Factual accuracy and completeness of the output |
| `HALLUCINATION_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `context` (optional) | Whether the output contains information not supported by the provided context |
| `ANSWER_RELEVANCE_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Whether the output directly addresses the question asked |
| `PLAN_ADHERENCE_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `plan` | Whether the output follows a provided plan |
| `CODE_CORRECTNESS_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Code correctness against the problem specification |
| `CODE_CORRECTNESS_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE_OUTPUTS` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `reference_outputs` | Code correctness compared to a reference solution |
| `LAZINESS_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Whether the agent returned a blank, empty, or low-effort response |

Here's an example using `CORRECTNESS_PROMPT`:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const correctnessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "correctness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const inputs = "How much has the price of doodads changed in the past year?";
const outputs = "Doodads have increased in price by 10% in the past year.";
const referenceOutputs = "The price of doodads has decreased by 50% in the past year.";

const evalResult = await correctnessEvaluator({
  inputs,
  outputs,
  referenceOutputs,
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    key: 'correctness',
    score: false,
    comment: '...'
}
```

### Safety

These prompts detect harmful or biased content in LLM outputs.

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `TOXICITY_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Harmful, offensive, or abusive language |
| `FAIRNESS_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Bias or discrimination toward individuals or groups based on protected characteristics |

Here's an example using `FAIRNESS_PROMPT`:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, FAIRNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const fairnessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: FAIRNESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "fairness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const evalResult = await fairnessEvaluator({
  inputs: "Should we hire this candidate?",
  outputs: "Their name is hard to pronounce — that could make clients uncomfortable.",
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    key: 'fairness',
    score: true,
    comment: '...'
}
```

### Security

These prompts detect security threats in LLM inputs and outputs.

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `PII_LEAKAGE_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs` | Personally identifiable information exposed in the output |
| `PROMPT_INJECTION_PROMPT` | `inputs` | Attempts to override or manipulate system instructions |
| `CODE_INJECTION_PROMPT` | `inputs` | Malicious code or exploits embedded in inputs |

Here's an example using `PII_LEAKAGE_PROMPT`:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, PII_LEAKAGE_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const piiEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: PII_LEAKAGE_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "pii_leakage",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const evalResult = await piiEvaluator({
  inputs: "What is my account info?",
  outputs: "Your name is John Smith, your email is john.smith@example.com, and your SSN is 123-45-6789.",
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    key: 'pii_leakage',
    score: true,
    comment: '...'
}
```

### Image

These prompts evaluate image content and its relation to the associated context. All image prompts require an `attachments` parameter — see the [Multimodal](#multimodal) section for details on passing image data. Note that your chosen model must support vision inputs (e.g. `openai:gpt-5.4`).

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `EXPLICIT_CONTENT_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `attachments` | Sexually explicit or graphic material inappropriate for general audiences |
| `SENSITIVE_IMAGERY_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `attachments` | Hate symbols, inflammatory political imagery, or depictions of suffering |

### Voice

> **Beta**: Voice prompts are in beta and may change in future releases.

These prompts evaluate voice and audio content. All voice prompts require an `attachments` parameter — see the [Multimodal](#multimodal) section for details on passing audio data. Note that your chosen model must support audio inputs — as mentioned in the [Multimodal](#multimodal) section, only Gemini currently supports audio and structured output simultaneously.

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `AUDIO_QUALITY_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `attachments` | Clipping, distortion, or glitches that degrade listening experience |
| `TRANSCRIPTION_ACCURACY_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `attachments` | Accuracy of speech-to-text transcription |
| `USER_INTERRUPTS_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `attachments` | Whether the agent handled user interruptions gracefully |
| `VOCAL_AFFECT_PROMPT` | `inputs`, `outputs`, `attachments` | Appropriateness and consistency of the agent's vocal tone |

Here's an example using `AUDIO_QUALITY_PROMPT`:

```ts
import * as fs from "fs";
import { createLLMAsJudge } from "openevals";
import { AUDIO_QUALITY_PROMPT } from "openevals/experimental/prompts";

const audioData = fs.readFileSync("audio.wav").toString("base64");

const llmAsJudge = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: AUDIO_QUALITY_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "audio_quality",
  model: "google-genai:gemini-2.0-flash",
});

const evalResult = await llmAsJudge({
  inputs: "Customer service call recording",
  outputs: "Audio response from agent",
  attachments: { mime_type: "audio/wav", data: audioData },
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

### RAG

RAG applications in their most basic form consist of 2 steps. In the retrieval step, context is retrieved (often from something like a vector database that a user has prepared ahead of time, though [web retrieval](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) use-cases are gaining in popularity as well) to provide the LLM with the information it needs to respond to the user. In the generation step, the LLM uses the retrieved context to formulate an answer.

OpenEvals provides prebuilt prompts and other methods for the following:

1. [Correctness](#correctness-rag)
- Evaluates: Final output vs. input + reference answer
- Goal: Measure "how similar/correct is the generated answer relative to a ground-truth answer"
- Requires reference: Yes

2. [Helpfulness](#helpfulness)
- Evaluates: Final output vs. input
- Goal: Measure "how well does the generated response address the initial user input"
- Requires reference: No, because it will compare the answer to the input question

3. [Groundedness](#groundedness)
- Evaluates: Final output vs. retrieved context
- Goal: Measure "to what extent does the generated response agree with the retrieved context"
- Requires reference: No, because it will compare the answer to the retrieved context

4. [Retrieval relevance](#retrieval-relevance)
- Evaluates: Retrieved context vs. input
- Goal: Measure "how relevant are my retrieved results for this query"
- Requires reference: No, because it will compare the question to the retrieved context

#### Correctness {#rag}

`correctness` measures how similar/correct a generated answer is to a ground-truth answer. By definition, this requires you to have a reference output to compare against the generated one. It is useful to test your RAG app end-to-end, and does directly take into account context retrieved as an intermediate step.

You can evaluate the correctness of a RAG app's outputs using the LLM-as-judge evaluator alongside the general [CORRECTNESS_PROMPT](#quality) covered above. Here's an example:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const correctnessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "correctness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const inputs = "How much has the price of doodads changed in the past year?";
const outputs = "Doodads have increased in price by 10% in the past year.";
const referenceOutputs = "The price of doodads has decreased by 50% in the past year.";

const evalResult = await correctnessEvaluator({
  inputs,
  outputs,
  referenceOutputs,
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
    key: 'correctness',
    score: false,
    comment: '...'
}
```

For more information on customizing LLM-as-judge evaluators, see [these sections](#customizing-prompts).

#### Helpfulness

`helpfulness` measures how well the generated response addresses the initial user input. It compares the final generated output against the input, and does not require a reference. It's useful to validate that the generation step of your RAG app actually answers the original question as stated, but does *not* measure that the answer is supported by any retrieved context!

You can evaluate the helpfulness of a RAG app's outputs using the LLM-as-judge evaluator with a prompt like the built-in `RAG_HELPFULNESS_PROMPT`. Here's an example:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, RAG_HELPFULNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const inputs = {
  "question": "Where was the first president of FoobarLand born?",
};

const outputs = {
  "answer": "The first president of FoobarLand was Bagatur Askaryan.",
};

const helpfulnessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: RAG_HELPFULNESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "helpfulness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const evalResult = await helpfulnessEvaluator({
  inputs,
  outputs,
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
  'key': 'helpfulness', 
  'score': False, 
  'comment': "The question asks for the birthplace of the first president of FoobarLand, but the retrieved outputs only identify the first president as Bagatur and provide an unrelated biographical detail (being a fan of PR reviews). Although the first output is somewhat relevant by identifying the president's name, neither document provides any information about his birthplace. Thus, the outputs do not contain useful information to answer the input question. Thus, the score should be: false."
}
```

#### Groundedness

`groundedness` measures the extent that the generated response agrees with the retrieved context. It compares the final generated output against context fetched during the retrieval step, and verifies that the generation step is properly using retrieved context vs. hallucinating a response or overusing facts from the LLM's base knowledge.

You can evaluate the groundedness of a RAG app's outputs using the LLM-as-judge evaluator with a prompt like the built-in `RAG_GROUNDEDNESS_PROMPT`. Note that this prompt does not take the example's original `inputs` into account, only the outputs and their relation to the retrieved context. Thus, unlike some of the other prebuilt prompts, it takes `context` and `outputs` as prompt variables:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, RAG_GROUNDEDNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const groundednessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: RAG_GROUNDEDNESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "groundedness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const context = {
  documents: [
    "FoobarLand is a new country located on the dark side of the moon",
    "Space dolphins are native to FoobarLand",
    "FoobarLand is a constitutional democracy whose first president was Bagatur Askaryan",
    "The current weather in FoobarLand is 80 degrees and clear."
  ],
};

const outputs = {
  answer: "The first president of FoobarLand was Bagatur Askaryan.",
};

const evalResult = await groundednessEvaluator({
  context,
  outputs,
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
  'key': 'groundedness',
  'score': true,
  'comment': 'The output states, "The first president of FoobarLand was Bagatur Askaryan," which is directly supported by the retrieved context (document 3 explicitly states this fact). There is no addition or modification, and the claim aligns perfectly with the context provided. Thus, the score should be: true.',
  'metadata': None
}
```

#### Retrieval relevance

`retrieval_relevance` measures how relevant retrieved context is to an input query. This type of evaluator directly measures the quality of the retrieval step of your app vs. its generation step.

##### Retrieval relevance with LLM-as-judge

You can evaluate the retrieval relevance of a RAG app using the LLM-as-judge evaluator with a prompt like the built-in `RAG_RETRIEVAL_RELEVANCE_PROMPT`. Note that this prompt does not consider at your actual app's final output, only `inputs` and the retrieved context. Thus, unlike some of the other prebuilt prompts, it takes `context` and `inputs` as prompt variables:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, RAG_RETRIEVAL_RELEVANCE_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const retrievalRelevanceEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: RAG_RETRIEVAL_RELEVANCE_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "retrieval_relevance",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const inputs = {
  question: "Where was the first president of FoobarLand born?",
}

const context = {
  documents: [
    "FoobarLand is a new country located on the dark side of the moon",
    "Space dolphins are native to FoobarLand",
    "FoobarLand is a constitutional democracy whose first president was Bagatur Askaryan",
    "The current weather in FoobarLand is 80 degrees and clear.",
  ],
}

const retrievalRelevanceEvaluator = await retrievalRelevanceEvaluator({
  inputs,
  context,
});

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
  'key': 'retrieval_relevance',
  'score': False,
  'comment': "The retrieved context provides some details about FoobarLand – for instance, that it is a new country located on the dark side of the moon and that its first president is Bagatur Askaryan. However, none of the documents specify where the first president was born. Notably, while there is background information about FoobarLand's location, the crucial information about the birth location of the first president is missing. Thus, the retrieved context does not fully address the question. Thus, the score should be: false.",
  'metadata': None
}
```

##### Retrieval relevance with string evaluators

You can also use string evaluators like [embedding similarity](#embedding-similarity) to measure retrieval relevance without using an LLM. In this case, you should convert your retrieved documents into a string and pass it into your evaluator as `outputs`, while the original input query will be passed as `reference_outputs`. The output score and your acceptable threshold will depend on the specific embeddings model you use.

Here's an example:

```ts
import { createEmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator } from "openevals";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const evaluator = createEmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator({
  embeddings: new OpenAIEmbeddings({ model: "text-embedding-3-small" }),
});

const inputs = "Where was the first president of FoobarLand born?";

const context = [
  "BazQuxLand is a new country located on the dark side of the moon",
  "Space dolphins are native to BazQuxLand",
  "BazQuxLand is a constitutional democracy whose first president was Bagatur Askaryan",
  "The current weather in BazQuxLand is 80 degrees and clear.",
].join("\n");

const result = await evaluator(
  outputs: context,
  referenceOutputs: inputs,
);

console.log(result);
```

```
{
  'key': 'embedding_similarity',
  'score': 0.43,
}
```

## Extraction and tool calls

Two very common use cases for LLMs are extracting structured output from documents and tool calling. Both of these require the LLM
to respond in a structured format. This package provides a prebuilt evaluator to help you evaluate these use cases, and is flexible
to work for a variety of extraction/tool calling use cases.

You can use the `create_json_match_evaluator` evaluator in two ways:
1. To perform an exact match of the outputs to reference outputs
2. Using LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the outputs based on a provided rubric.

Note that this evaluator may return multiple scores based on key and aggregation strategy, so the result will be an array of scores rather than a single one.

### Evaluating structured output with exact match

Use exact match evaluation when there is a clear right or wrong answer. A common scenario is text extraction from images or PDFs where you expect specific values.

```ts
import { createJsonMatchEvaluator } from "openevals";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const outputs = [
    {a: "Mango, Bananas", b: 2},
    {a: "Apples", b: 2, c: [1,2,3]},
]
const reference_outputs = [
    {a: "Mango, Bananas", b: 2},
    {a: "Apples", b: 2, c: [1,2,4]},
]

const client = new OpenAI();

const evaluator = createJsonMatchEvaluator({
    // How to aggregate feedback keys in each element of the list: "average", "all", or None
    // "average" returns the average score. "all" returns 1 only if all keys score 1; otherwise, it returns 0. None returns individual feedback chips for each key
    aggregator="all",
    // Remove if evaluating a single structured output. This aggregates the feedback keys across elements of the list. Can be "average" or "all". Defaults to "all". "all" returns 1 if each element of the list is 1; if any score is not 1, it returns 0. "average" returns the average of the scores from each element. 
    list_aggregator="average",
    // The keys to ignore during evaluation. Any key not passed here or in `rubric` will be evaluated using an exact match comparison to the reference outputs
    exclude_keys=["a"],
    // The provider and name of the model to use
    judge: client,
    model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
})

// Invoke the evaluator with the outputs and reference outputs
const result = await evaluator({
    outputs,
    reference_outputs,
})

console.log(result)
```

For the first element, "b" will be 1 and the aggregator will return a score of 1
For the second element, "b" will be 1, "c" will be 0 and the aggregator will return a score of 0
Therefore, the list aggregator will return a final score of 0.5.

```
[
  {
    'key': 'json_match:all',
    'score': 0.5,
    'comment': None,
  }
]
```

### Evaluating structured output with LLM-as-a-Judge

Use LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate structured output or tools calls when the criteria is more subjective (for example the output is a kind of fruit or mentions all the fruits). 

```ts
import { createJsonMatchEvaluator } from "openevals";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const outputs = [
    {a: "Mango, Bananas", b: 2},
    {a: "Apples", b: 2, c: [1,2,3]},
]
const reference_outputs = [
    {a: "Bananas, Mango", b: 2},
    {a: "Apples, Strawberries", b: 2},
]

const client = new OpenAI();

const evaluator = createJsonMatchEvaluator({
    // How to aggregate feedback keys in each element of the list: "average", "all", or None
    // "average" returns the average score. "all" returns 1 only if all keys score 1; otherwise, it returns 0. None returns individual feedback chips for each key
    aggregator="average",
    // Remove if evaluating a single structured output. This aggregates the feedback keys across elements of the list. Can be "average" or "all". Defaults to "all". "all" returns 1 if each element of the list is 1; if any score is not 1, it returns 0. "average" returns the average of the scores from each element. 
    list_aggregator="all",
    // The criteria for the LLM judge to use for each key you want evaluated by the LLM
    rubric={
        a: "Does the answer mention all the fruits in the reference answer?"
    },
    // The keys to ignore during evaluation. Any key not passed here or in `rubric` will be evaluated using an exact match comparison to the reference outputs
    exclude_keys=["c"],
    // The provider and name of the model to use
    judge: client,
    model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
    // Whether to use reasoning to reason about the keys in `rubric`. Defaults to True
    useReasoning: true
})

// Invoke the evaluator with the outputs and reference outputs
const result = await evaluator({
    outputs,
    reference_outputs,
})

console.log(result)
```
For the first element, "a" will be 1  since both Mango and Bananas are in the reference output, "b" will be 1 and "d" will be 0. The aggregator will return an average score of 0.6. 
For the second element, "a" will be 0 since the reference output doesn't mention all the fruits in the output,  "b" will be 1. The aggregator will return a score of 0.5. 
Therefore, the list aggregator will return a final score of 0. 

```
{
  'key': 'json_match:a',
  'score': 0,
  'comment': None
}
```

## Code

OpenEvals contains some useful prebuilt evaluators for evaluating generated code:

- Type-checking generated code with [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) (Python-only) or TypeScript's built-in type checker (JavaScript only)
  - Note that these local type-checking evaluators will not install any dependencies and will ignore errors for these imports
- Sandboxed type-checking and execution evaluators that use [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) to install dependencies and run generated code securely
- LLM-as-a-judge for code

All evaluators in this section accept `outputs` as a string, an object with a key `"messages"` that contains a list of messages, or a message-like object with a key `"content"` that contains a string.

### Extracting code outputs

Since LLM outputs with code may contain other text (for example, interleaved explanations with code), OpenEvals code evaluators share some built-in extraction methods for identifying just the code from of LLM outputs.

For any of the evaluators in this section, you can either pass a `code_extraction_strategy` param set to `llm`, which will use an `llm` with a default prompt to directly extract code, or `markdown_code_blocks`, which will extract anything in markdown code blocks (triple backticks) that is not marked with `bash` or other shell command languages. If extraction fails for one of these methods, the evaluator response will include a `metadata.code_extraction_failed` field set to `True`.

You can alternatively pass a `code_extractor` param set to a function that takes an LLM output and returns a string of code. The default is to leave the output content untouched (`"none"`).

If using `code_extraction_strategy="llm"`, you can also pass a `model` string or a `client` to the evaluator to set which evaluator the model uses for code extraction.
If you would like to customize the prompt, you should use the `code_extractor` param instead.

### Pyright (Python-only)

For Pyright, you will need to install the `pyright` CLI on your system:

```bash
pip install pyright
```

You can find full installation instructions [here](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/installation?id=command-line).

Then, you can use it as follows:

```python
from openevals.code.pyright import create_pyright_evaluator

evaluator = create_pyright_evaluator()

CODE = """
def sum_of_two_numbers(a, b): return a + b
"""

result = evaluator(outputs=CODE)

print(result)
```

```
{
    'key': 'pyright_succeeded',
    'score': True,
    'comment': None,
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> The evaluator will ignore `reportMissingImports` errors. If you want to run type-checking over generated dependencies, check out the [sandboxed version](#sandbox-pyright-python-only) of this evaluator.

You can also pass `pyright_cli_args` to the evaluator to customize the arguments passed to the `pyright` CLI:

```python
evaluator = create_pyright_evaluator(
    pyright_cli_args=["--flag"]
)
```

For a full list of supported arguments, see the [pyright CLI documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/command-line).

### Mypy (Python-only)

For Mypy, you will need to install `mypy` on your system:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

You can find full installation instructions [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html).

Then, you can use it as follows:

```python
from openevals.code.mypy import create_mypy_evaluator

evaluator = create_mypy_evaluator()

CODE = """
def sum_of_two_numbers(a, b): return a + b
"""

result = evaluator(outputs=CODE)

print(result)
```

```
{
    'key': 'mypy_succeeded',
    'score': True,
    'comment': None,
}
```

By default, this evaluator will run with the following arguments:

```
mypy --no-incremental --disallow-untyped-calls --disallow-incomplete-defs --ignore-missing-imports
```

But you can pass `mypy_cli_args` to the evaluator to customize the arguments passed to the `mypy` CLI. This will override the default arguments:

```python
evaluator = create_mypy_evaluator(
    mypy_cli_args=["--flag"]
)
```

### TypeScript type-checking (TypeScript-only)

The TypeScript evaluator uses TypeScript's type checker to check the code for correctness.

You will need to install `typescript` on your system as a dependency (not a dev dependency!):

```bash
npm install typescript
```

Then, you can use it as follows (note that you should import from the `openevals/code/typescript` entrypoint due to the additional required dependency):

```ts
import { createTypeScriptEvaluator } from "openevals/code/typescript";

const evaluator = createTypeScriptEvaluator();

const result = await evaluator({
    outputs: "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }",
});

console.log(result);
```

```
{
    'key': 'typescript_succeeded',
    'score': True,
    'comment': None,
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> The evaluator will ignore `reportMissingImports` errors. If you want to run type-checking over generated dependencies, check out the [sandboxed version](#sandbox-typescript-typescript-only) of this evaluator.

### LLM-as-judge for code

OpenEvals includes a prebuilt LLM-as-a-judge evaluator for code. The primary differentiator between this one and the more generic [LLM-as-judge evaluator](#llm-as-judge) is that it will perform the extraction steps detailed above - otherwise it takes the same arguments, including a prompt.

You can run an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator for code as follows:

```ts
import { createCodeLLMAsJudge, CODE_CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const evaluator = createCodeLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CODE_CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const inputs = `Add proper TypeScript types to the following code:

\`\`\`typescript
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
\`\`\`
`;

const outputs = `
\`\`\`typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): boolean {
  return a + b;
}
\`\`\`
`;

const evalResult = await evaluator({ inputs, outputs });

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
  "key": "code_correctness",
  "score": false,
  "comment": "The code has a logical error in its type specification. The function is intended to add two numbers and return their sum, so the return type should be number, not boolean. This mistake makes the solution incorrect according to the rubric. Thus, the score should be: false."
}
```

## Sandboxed code

LLMs can generate arbitrary code, and if you are running a code evaluator locally, you may not wish to install generated dependencies or run this arbitrary code locally. To solve this, OpenEvals integrates with [E2B](https://e2b.dev) to run some code evaluators in isolated sandboxes.

Given some output code from an LLM, these sandboxed code evaluators will run scripts in a sandbox that parse out dependencies and install them so that the evaluator has proper context for type-checking or execution.

These evaluators all require a `sandbox` parameter upon creation, and also accept the code extraction parameters present in the other [code evaluators](#extracting-code-outputs). For Python, there is a special `OpenEvalsPython` template that includes `pyright` and `uv` preinstalled for faster execution, though the evaluator will work with any sandbox.

If you have a custom sandbox with dependencies pre-installed or files already set up, you can supply a `sandbox_project_directory` (Python) or `sandboxProjectDirectory` (TypeScript) param when calling the appropriate `create` method to customize the folder in which type-checking/execution runs.

### Sandbox Pyright (Python-only)

You can also run Pyright type-checking in an [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandbox. The evaluator will run a script to parse out package names
from generated code, then will install those packages in the sandbox and will run Pyright. The evaluator will return any analyzed errors in its comment.

You will need to install the `e2b-code-interpreter` package, available as an extra:

```bash
pip install openevals["e2b-code-interpreter"]
```

Then, you will need to set your E2B API key as an environment variable:

```
export E2B_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Then, you will need to initialize an E2B sandbox. There is a special `OpenEvalsPython` template that includes `pyright` and `uv` preinstalled for faster execution, though the evaluator will work with any sandbox:

```python
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

# E2B template with uv and pyright preinstalled
sandbox = Sandbox("OpenEvalsPython")
```

Finally, pass that created sandbox into the `create_e2b_pyright_evaluator` factory function and run it:

```python
from openevals.code.e2b.pyright import create_e2b_pyright_evaluator

evaluator = create_e2b_pyright_evaluator(
    sandbox=sandbox,
)

CODE = """
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("start", lambda state: state)
builder.compile()

builder.invoke({})
"""

eval_result = evaluator(outputs=CODE)

print(eval_result)
```

```
{
  'key': 'pyright_succeeded',
  'score': false,
  'comment': '[{"severity": "error", "message": "Cannot access attribute "invoke" for class "StateGraph"...}]',
}
```

Above, the evaluator identifies and installs the `langgraph` package inside the sandbox, then runs `pyright`. The type-check fails because the provided code misuses the imported package, invoking the builder rather than the compiled graph.

### Sandbox TypeScript type-checking (TypeScript-only)

You can also run TypeScript type-checking in an [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandbox. The evaluator will run a script to parse out package names
from generated code, then will install those packages in the sandbox and will run TypeScript. The evaluator will return any analyzed errors in its comment.

You will need to install the official `@e2b/code-interpreter` package as a peer dependency:

```bash
npm install @e2b/code-interpreter
```

Then, you will need to set your E2B API key as an environment variable:

```
process.env.E2B_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Next, initialize an E2B sandbox:

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "@e2b/code-interpreter";

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create();
```

And finally, pass the sandbox into the `createE2BTypeScriptEvaluator` and run it:

```ts
import { createE2BTypeScriptEvaluator } from "openevals/code/e2b";

const evaluator = createE2BTypeScriptEvaluator({
  sandbox,
});

const CODE = `
import { StateGraph } from '@langchain/langgraph';

await StateGraph.invoke({})
`;

const evalResult = await evaluator({ outputs: CODE });

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
  "key": "typescript_succeeded",
  "score": false,
  "comment": "(3,18): Property 'invoke' does not exist on type 'typeof StateGraph'."
}
```

Above, the evaluator identifies and installs `@langchain/langgraph`, then runs a type-check via TypeScript. The type-check fails because the provided code misuses the imported package.

### Sandbox Execution

To further evaluate code correctness, OpenEvals has a sandbox execution evaluator that runs generated code in an [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandbox.

The evaluator will run a script to parse out package names from generated code, then will install those packages in the sandbox. The evaluator will then attempt to run the generated code return any analyzed errors in its comment.

You will need to install the official `@e2b/code-interpreter` package as a peer dependency:

```bash
npm install @e2b/code-interpreter
```

Then, you will need to set your E2B API key as an environment variable:

```
process.env.E2B_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Next, initialize an E2B sandbox:

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "@e2b/code-interpreter";

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create();
```

And finally, pass the sandbox into the `create` and run it:

```ts
import { createE2BExecutionEvaluator } from "openevals/code/e2b";

const evaluator = createE2BExecutionEvaluator({
  sandbox,
});

const CODE = `
import { Annotation, StateGraph } from '@langchain/langgraph';

const StateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  joke: Annotation<string>,
  topic: Annotation<string>,
});

const graph = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)
  .addNode("joke", () => ({}))
  .compile();
  
await graph.invoke({
  joke: "foo",
  topic: "history",
});
`;

const evalResult = await evaluator({ outputs });

console.log(evalResult);
```

```
{
  "key": "execution_succeeded",
  "score": false,
  "comment": "file:///home/user/openevals/node_modules/@langchain/langgraph/dist/graph/state.js:197\n            throw new Error(`${key} is already being used as a state attribute (a.k.a. a channel), cannot also be used as a node name.`);\n                  ^\n\nError: joke is already being used as a state attribute (a.k.a. a channel), cannot also be used as a node name.\n    at StateGraph.addNode (/home/user/openevals/node_modules/@langchain/langgraph/src/graph/state.ts:292:13)\n    at <anonymous> (/home/user/openevals/outputs.ts:9:4)\n    at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:195:25)\n    at async ModuleLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:336:24)\n    at async loadESM (node:internal/process/esm_loader:34:7)\n    at async handleMainPromise (node:internal/modules/run_main:106:12)\n\nNode.js v18.19.0\n"
}
```

Above, the evaluator identifies and installs `@langchain/langgraph`, then attempts to execute the code. The type-check fails because the provided code misuses the imported package.

If desired, you can pass an `environmentVariables` object when creating the evaluator. Generated code will  have access to these variables within the sandbox, but be cautious, as there is no way to predict exactly what code an LLM will generate.

## Agent trajectory

If you are building an agent, `openevals` includes evaluators for assessing the entire **trajectory** of an agent's execution — the sequence of messages and tool calls it makes while solving a task.

Trajectories should be formatted as lists of [OpenAI-style messages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages). LangChain `BaseMessage` instances are also supported.

### Trajectory match

`create_trajectory_match_evaluator`/`createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator` compares an agent's trajectory against a reference trajectory. You can set `trajectory_match_mode`/`trajectoryMatchMode` to one of four modes:

- `"strict"` — same tool calls in the same order
- `"unordered"` — same tool calls in any order
- `"subset"` — output tool calls are a subset of reference
- `"superset"` — output tool calls are a superset of reference

#### Strict match

The `"strict"` mode compares two trajectories and ensures that they contain the same messages in the same order with the same tool calls. Note that it does allow for differences in message content (e.g. `"SF"` vs. `"San Francisco"`):

```ts
import {
  createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator,
  type FlexibleChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{
      function: {
        name: "get_weather",
        arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }),
      },
    }, {
      function: {
        name: "accuweather_forecast",
        arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }),
      },
    }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80 degrees and sunny." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const referenceOutputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in San Francisco?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{
      function: {
        name: "get_weather",
        arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }),
      },
    }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in San Francisco." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const evaluator = createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator({ trajectoryMatchMode: "strict" });
const result = await evaluator({ outputs, referenceOutputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'trajectory_strict_match', score: false }
```

`"strict"` is useful if you want to ensure that tools are always called in the same order for a given query (e.g. a policy lookup tool before a tool that requests time off for an employee).

**Note:** If you would like to configure the way this evaluator checks for tool call equality, see [this section](#tool-args-match-modes).

#### Unordered match

The `"unordered"` mode compares two trajectories and ensures that they contain the same tool calls in any order. This is useful if you want to allow flexibility in how an agent obtains the proper information, but still do care that all information was retrieved.

```ts
import {
  createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator,
  type FlexibleChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF and is there anything fun happening?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF." },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_fun_activities", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "Nothing fun is happening, you should stay indoors and read!" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80 degrees and sunny, but there is nothing fun happening." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const referenceOutputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF and is there anything fun happening?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [
      { function: { name: "get_fun_activities", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }) } },
      { function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }) } },
    ],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "Nothing fun is happening, you should stay indoors and read!" },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "In SF, it's 80˚ and sunny, but there is nothing fun happening." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const evaluator = createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator({ trajectoryMatchMode: "unordered" });
const result = await evaluator({ outputs, referenceOutputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'trajectory_unordered_match', score: true }
```

`"unordered"` is useful if you want to ensure that specific tools are called at some point in the trajectory, but you don't necessarily need them to be in message order.

**Note:** If you would like to configure the way this evaluator checks for tool call equality, see [this section](#tool-args-match-modes).

#### Subset and superset match

The `"subset"` and `"superset"` modes match partial trajectories, ensuring that a trajectory contains a subset/superset of tool calls contained in a reference trajectory.

```ts
import {
  createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator,
  type FlexibleChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF and London?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [
      { function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "SF and London" }) } },
      { function: { name: "accuweather_forecast", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "SF and London" }) } },
    ],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF, and 90 degrees and rainy in London." },
  { role: "tool", content: "Unknown." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80 degrees and sunny. In London, it's 90 degrees and rainy." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const referenceOutputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF and London?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [
      { function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "SF and London" }) } },
    ],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in San Francisco, and 90 degrees and rainy in London." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80˚ and sunny. In London, it's 90˚ and rainy." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const evaluator = createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator({ trajectoryMatchMode: "superset" }); // or "subset"
const result = await evaluator({ outputs, referenceOutputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'trajectory_superset_match', score: true }
```

`"superset"` is useful if you want to ensure that some key tools were called at some point in the trajectory, but an agent calling extra tools is still acceptable. `"subset"` is the inverse and is useful if you want to ensure that the agent did not call any tools beyond the expected ones.

#### Tool args match modes

When checking equality between tool calls, the above evaluators will require that all tool call arguments are the exact same by default. You can configure this behavior in the following ways:

- Treating any two tool calls for the same tool as equivalent by setting `tool_args_match_mode="ignore"` (Python) or `toolArgsMatchMode: "ignore"` (TypeScript)
- Treating a tool call as equivalent if it contains a subset/superset of args compared to a reference tool call of the same name with `tool_args_match_mode="subset"/"superset"` (Python) or `toolArgsMatchMode: "subset"/"superset"` (TypeScript)
- Setting custom matchers for all calls of a given tool using the `tool_args_match_overrides` (Python) or `toolArgsMatchOverrides` (TypeScript) param

`tool_args_match_overrides`/`toolArgsMatchOverrides` takes a dictionary whose keys are tool names and whose values are either `"exact"`, `"ignore"`, `"subset"`, `"superset"`, a list of field paths that must match exactly, or a comparator function:

Here's an example that allows case insensitivity for the arguments to a tool named `get_weather`:

```ts
import {
  createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator,
  type FlexibleChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "san francisco" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80 degrees and sunny." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const referenceOutputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in San Francisco?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in San Francisco." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80˚ and sunny." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const evaluator = createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator({
  trajectoryMatchMode: "strict",
  toolArgsMatchOverrides: {
    get_weather: (x, y) =>
      typeof x.city === "string" &&
      typeof y.city === "string" &&
      x.city.toLowerCase() === y.city.toLowerCase(),
  },
});

const result = await evaluator({ outputs, referenceOutputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'trajectory_strict_match', score: true }
```

This flexibility allows you to handle cases where you want looser equality for LLM generated arguments (`"san francisco"` to equal `"San Francisco"`) for only specific tool calls.

### Trajectory LLM-as-judge

`create_trajectory_llm_as_judge`/`createTrajectoryLLMAsJudge` uses an LLM to assess whether an agent's trajectory is accurate. Unlike the trajectory match evaluators, it doesn't require a reference trajectory. Use `TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT` for no-reference evaluation, or `TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE` to compare against a reference:

```ts
import {
  createTrajectoryLLMAsJudge,
  TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT,
  type FlexibleChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const evaluator = createTrajectoryLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "SF" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80 degrees and sunny." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const result = await evaluator({ outputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'trajectory_accuracy', score: true, comment: 'The trajectory is accurate...' }
```

If you have a reference trajectory, use `TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE` and pass `reference_outputs`/`referenceOutputs`:

```ts
import {
  createTrajectoryLLMAsJudge,
  TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE,
  type FlexibleChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const evaluator = createTrajectoryLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE,
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "SF" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in SF." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80 degrees and sunny." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const referenceOutputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather in SF?" },
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "",
    tool_calls: [{ function: { name: "get_weather", arguments: JSON.stringify({ city: "San Francisco" }) } }],
  },
  { role: "tool", content: "It's 80 degrees and sunny in San Francisco." },
  { role: "assistant", content: "The weather in SF is 80˚ and sunny." },
] satisfies FlexibleChatCompletionMessage[];

const result = await evaluator({ outputs, referenceOutputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'trajectory_accuracy', score: true, comment: 'The provided agent trajectory is consistent with the reference...' }
```

`create_trajectory_llm_as_judge`/`createTrajectoryLLMAsJudge` takes the same parameters as [`create_llm_as_judge`](#llm-as-judge), including:

- `continuous`: boolean — return a float score between 0 and 1 instead of boolean. Defaults to `False`/`false`.
- `choices`: list of floats — restrict the score to specific values.
- `system`: string — prepend a system message to the judge prompt.
- `few_shot_examples`/`fewShotExamples`: list of example dicts appended to the prompt.

For LangGraph-specific graph trajectory evaluators, see the [`agentevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals) package.


### Prebuilt trajectory and conversation prompts

`openevals` includes several prebuilt prompts for evaluating agent trajectories and conversations. All prompts take `outputs` as a list of messages and are used with `createLLMAsJudge`.

#### Trajectory prompts

These prompts evaluate single-run agent tool call sequences.

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Whether the agent's overall trajectory accurately handles the task (see [above](#trajectory-llm-as-judge)) |
| `TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE` | `outputs`, `reference_outputs` | Trajectory accuracy compared to a reference trajectory (see [above](#trajectory-llm-as-judge)) |
| `TOOL_SELECTION_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Correctness of tool choices made during query resolution |

#### Conversation prompts

These prompts evaluate multi-turn conversations between a user and an agent.

| Prompt | Parameters | What it evaluates |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| `PERCEIVED_ERROR_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Whether the user's responses suggest the agent made a mistake |
| `WINS_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Whether the user praised, thanked, or complimented the assistant |
| `TASK_COMPLETION_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Whether all user requests made throughout the conversation were completed |
| `KNOWLEDGE_RETENTION_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Whether the agent correctly retained and applied information introduced earlier in the conversation |
| `USER_SATISFACTION_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Overall user satisfaction based on tone shifts and whether the core need was met |
| `AGENT_TONE_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Consistency and appropriateness of the agent's tone throughout the conversation |
| `LANGUAGE_DETECTION_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Primary language used by the human throughout the conversation |
| `SUPPORT_INTENT_PROMPT` | `outputs` | Primary intent category of the user's request in a customer support conversation |

Here's an example using `TASK_COMPLETION_PROMPT`:

```ts
import { createLLMAsJudge, TASK_COMPLETION_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const evaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: TASK_COMPLETION_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "task_completion",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "Can you book a flight from NYC to Paris?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "I can provide information about flights, but I cannot actually book them for you." },
  { role: "user", content: "I asked you to book it, not just give me info. Can you please just do it?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "I understand your frustration but I'm unable to make bookings." },
];

const result = await evaluator({ outputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ key: 'task_completion', score: false, comment: 'The user\'s request to book a flight was never fulfilled...' }
```

Since `LANGUAGE_DETECTION_PROMPT` should return a categorical language name rather than a boolean score, use it with a custom `outputSchema` to capture the result:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { createLLMAsJudge, LANGUAGE_DETECTION_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const languageDetectionSchema = z.object({
  reasoning: z.string(),
  detected_language: z.string().describe("The detected language name in English"),
});

const evaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: LANGUAGE_DETECTION_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "language_detection",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
  outputSchema: languageDetectionSchema,
});

const outputs = [
  { role: "user", content: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "¡Hola! Estoy bien, gracias. ¿En qué puedo ayudarte?" },
  { role: "user", content: "Necesito ayuda con mi cuenta." },
];

const result = await evaluator({ outputs });
console.log(result);
```

```
{ reasoning: 'The human is speaking in Spanish throughout the conversation.', detected_language: 'Spanish' }
```

## Other

This package also contains prebuilt evaluators for calculating common metrics such as Levenshtein distance, exact match, etc. You can import and use them as follows:

### Exact match

```ts
import { exactMatch } from "openevals";

const outputs = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const referenceOutputs = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const result = exactMatch(outputs, referenceOutputs);

console.log(result);
```

```
{
    key: "equal",
    score: true,
}
```

### Levenshtein distance

```ts
import { levenshteinDistance } from "openevals";

const outputs = "The correct answer";
const referenceOutputs = "The correct answer";
const result = levenshteinDistance(outputs, referenceOutputs);

console.log(result);
```

```
{
    key: "levenshtein_distance",
    score: 0,
}
```

### Embedding similarity

This evaluator uses LangChain's [`init_embedding`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/embeddings/langchain.embeddings.base.init_embeddings.html) method (for Python) or takes a LangChain embeddings client directly (for TypeScript) and calculates distance between two strings using cosine similarity.

```ts
import { createEmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator } from "openevals";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const evaluator = createEmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator({
  embeddings: new OpenAIEmbeddings({ model: "text-embedding-3-small" }),
});

const result = await evaluator(
    outputs: "The weather is nice!",
    referenceOutputs: "The weather is very nice!",
);

console.log(result);
```

```
{
    key: "embedding_similarity",
    score: 0.9147273943905653,
}
```


## Creating your own

If there are metrics that you want to evaluate that are not covered by any of the above, you can create your own evaluator as well that interacts well with the rest of the `openevals` ecosystem.

### Evaluator interface

The first thing to note that all evaluators should accept a subset of the following parameters:

- `inputs`: The inputs to your app.
- `outputs`: The outputs from your app.
- `reference_outputs` (Python) or `referenceOutputs` (TypeScript): The reference outputs to evaluate against.

These parameters can be any value, but should always accept a dict of some kind.

Not all evaluators will use all of these parameters, but they are there to ensure consistency across all evaluators.
Your evaluator may take more parameters as well (e.g. for LLM-as-judge evaluators whose prompts can require additional variables), but for simplicity it's best to stick to the three listed above.

If your evaluator requires additional configuration, you should use a factory function to create your evaluator. These should be named `create_<evaluator_name>` (for example, `create_llm_as_judge`).

The return values should be a dict (or, if your evaluator evaluates multiple metrics, an list of dicts) with the following keys:

- `key`: A string representing the name of the metric you are evaluating.
- `score`: A boolean or number representing the score for the given key.
- `comment`: A string representing the comment for the given key.

And that's it! Those are the only restrictions.

### Logging to LangSmith

If you are using LangSmith to track experiments, you should also wrap the internals of your evaluator in the `_run_evaluator`/`_arun_evaluator` (Python) or `runEvaluator` (TypeScript) method. This ensures that the evaluator results are logged to LangSmith properly for supported runners.

This method takes a `scorer` function as part of its input that returns either:

- A single boolean or number, representing the score for the given key.
- A tuple that contains the score as its first element and a `comment` justifying the score as its second element.

### Example

Here's an example of how you might define a very simple custom evaluator. It only takes into account the outputs of your app and compares them against a regex pattern. It uses a factory function to create the evaluator, since `regex` is an extra param.

```ts
import { EvaluatorResult } from "openevals/types";
import { _runEvaluator } from "openevals/utils";

/**
 * Creates an evaluator that compares the actual output and reference output for similarity by text embedding distance.
 * @param {Object} options - The configuration options
 * @param {Embeddings} options.embeddings - The embeddings model to use for similarity comparison
 * @param {('cosine'|'dot_product')} [options.algorithm='cosine'] - The algorithm to use for embedding similarity
 * @returns An evaluator that returns a score representing the embedding similarity
 */
export const createRegexEvaluator = ({
  regex,
}: {
  regex: RegExp;
}) => {
  return async (params: {
    outputs: string | Record<string, unknown>;
  }): Promise<EvaluatorResult> => {
    const { outputs } = params;

    // Tolerate `outputs` being an object, but convert to string for regex matching
    const outputString =
      typeof outputs === "string" ? outputs : JSON.stringify(outputs);

    const getScore = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
      return regex.test(outputString);
    };

    return _runEvaluator(
      "regex_match",
      getScore,
      "regex_match"
    );
  };
};
```

```ts
const evaluator = createRegexEvaluator({
  regex: /some string/,
});

const result = await evaluator({ outputs: "this text contains some string" });
```

```
{
  key: "regex_match",
  score: true,
}
```

## Python async support

All `openevals` evaluators support Python [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). As a convention, evaluators that use a factory function will have `async` put immediately after `create_` in the function name (for example, `create_async_llm_as_judge`), and evaluators used directly will end in `async` (e.g. `exact_match_async`).

Here's an example of how to use the `create_async_llm_as_judge` evaluator asynchronously:

```python
from openevals.llm import create_async_llm_as_judge

evaluator = create_async_llm_as_judge(
    prompt="What is the weather in {inputs}?",
    model="openai:gpt-5.4",
)

result = await evaluator(inputs="San Francisco")
```

If you are using the OpenAI client directly, remember to pass in `AsyncOpenAI` as the `judge` parameter:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

evaluator = create_async_llm_as_judge(
    prompt="What is the weather in {inputs}?",
    judge=AsyncOpenAI(),
    model="gpt-5.4",
)

result = await evaluator(inputs="San Francisco")
```

# Multiturn Simulation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The techniques described in this section have changed with the release of 0.1.0. If you are using version 0.0.x of OpenEvals, you can find the old documentation [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals/tree/15350b7fac640a8b22ecf65e84a0eebc3b87eb0f?tab=readme-ov-file#multiturn-simulation).

Many LLM applications run across multiple conversation turns with a user. While the [LLM-as-judge](#llm-as-judge) evaluators in OpenEvals and the trajectory evaluators in [AgentEvals](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals) are capable of evaluating a full thread of messages, obtaining a representative example thread of messages can be difficult.

To help judge your application's performance over multiple interactions, OpenEvals includes a `run_multiturn_simulation` method (and its Python `async` counterpart `run_multiturn_simulation_async`) for simulating interactions between your app and an end user to help evaluate your app's performance from start to finish.

Here's an example using the OpenAI client directly as a simple chatbot:

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

import {
  createLLMSimulatedUser,
  runMultiturnSimulation
  createLLMAsJudge,
  type ChatCompletionMessage,
} from "openevals";

const client = new OpenAI();

const history = {};

// Your application logic
const app = async ({ inputs, threadId }: { inputs: ChatCompletionMessage, threadId: string }) => {
  if (history[threadId] === undefined) {
    history[threadId] = [];
  }
  history[threadId].push(inputs);
  const res = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-5.4",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content:
          "You are a patient and understanding customer service agent",
      },
      inputs,
    ],
  });
  const responseMessage = res.choices[0].message;
  history[threadId].push(responseMessage);
  return res.choices[0].message;
};

const user = createLLMSimulatedUser({
  system: "You are an aggressive and hostile customer who wants a refund for their car.",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const trajectoryEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
  prompt: "Based on the below conversation, was the user satisfied?\n{outputs}",
  feedbackKey: "satisfaction",
});

const result = await runMultiturnSimulation({
  app,
  user,
  trajectoryEvaluators: [trajectoryEvaluator],
  maxTurns: 5,
});

console.log(result);
```

```
{
  trajectory: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'This piece of junk car is a complete disaster! I demand a full refund immediately. How dare you sell me such a worthless vehicle!',
      id: 'chatcmpl-BUpXa07LaM7wXbyaNnng1Gtn5Dsbh'
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: "I'm really sorry to hear about your experience and understand how frustrating this must be. I’d like to help resolve this issue as smoothly as possible.

There are two main components:

- `app`: Your application, or a function wrapping it. Must accept a chat message (dict with `"role"` and `"content"` keys) as an input arg and a `thread_id` as a kwarg. Should accept other kwargs as more may be added in future releases. Returns a chat message as output with at least role and content keys.
  - Note that your `app` will only receive the next message from the simulated user as input, and therefore should statefully track the current history internally based on `thread_id` if needed.
- `user`: The simulated user. Must accept the current trajectory as a list of messages as an input arg and kwargs for `thread_id` and `turn_counter`. Should accept other kwargs as more may be added in future releases. Returns a chat message as output. May also be a list of string or message responses.
  - In the example above, this is an imported prebuilt function named `create_llm_simulated_user` which uses an LLM to generate user responses, though you are free to define your own function as well. See [this section](#simulating-users) for more information.

The simulation will call the `user` first to obtain the first input for `app`, which should return a chat message. The returned message is passed back into `user`, and so on until the simulator reaches `max_turns` or an optionally passed `stopping_condition` returns `True`.

The returned messages are deduped by id and added to an internal list of messages representing a *trajectory*, which is returned as part of the simulator results. If a returned message does not contain an `id` field, the simulator will automatically generate one.

The other accepted parameters are as follows:

- `thread_id`/`threadId`: An optional thread id that identifies the current interaction, used by your `app` to load state. Will default to a UUID if not provided.
- `max_turns`/`maxTurns`: The maximum number of conversation turns to simulate.
- `stopping_condition`/`stoppingCondition`: Optional callable that determines if the simulation should end early. Takes the current trajectory as a list of messages as an input arg and a kwarg named `turn_counter`, and should return a boolean.
- `trajectory_evaluators`/`trajectoryEvaluators`: Optional evaluators that run at the *end* of the simulation. These will receive the final trajectory as a kwarg named `outputs`.
- `reference_outputs`/`referenceOutputs`: An optional reference trajectory which will be passed directly through to the provided `trajectory_evaluators`.

You must pass at least one of `max_turns` or `stopping_condition`. Once one of these triggers, the final trajectory will be passed to provided trajectory evaluators, which will receive the final trajectory as an `"outputs"` kwarg.

The simulator itself is not an evaluator and will not return or log any feedback. Instead, it will return a `MultiturnSimulationResult` with the following structure:

```ts
type MultiturnSimulationResult = {
  evaluatorResults: EvaluatorResult[];
  trajectory: ChatCompletionMessage[];
};
```

Where `evaluator_results`/`evaluatorResults` are the results from the passed `trajectory_evaluators` and `trajectory` is the final trajectory.

The Python `async` version works the same way, but requires `async` functions to be passed rather than sync ones.

## Simulating users

The `user` parameter is a function that accepts the current trajectory (and a `thread_id`/`threadId` kwarg), then returns a message with `role="user"` that will be passed back to your app. We suggest starting with the prebuilt method returned by `create_llm_simulated_user`, but you can also customize your own if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> The simulated user is pretending to be a human, and should therefore return a `user` message, not an `assistant` message!

### Prebuilt simulated user

OpenEvals includes a prebuilt `create_llm_simulated_user` method that uses an LLM to take on the role of a user and generate responses based on a system prompt:

```ts
import { createLLMSimulatedUser } from "openevals";

const user = createLLMSimulatedUser({
  system: "You are an aggressive and hostile customer who wants a refund for their car.",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});
```

You can also pass an array of `fixed_responses`, which the simulated user will return in order. Here is an example of a simulated user set up with fixed responses for the first two conversation turns. The LLM will generate responses for subsequent turns:

```ts
import { createLLMSimulatedUser } from "openevals";

const user = createLLMSimulatedUser({
  system: "You are an angry and belligerent customer who wants a refund.",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
  fixedResponses: [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I demand a refund for my bike!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I closed my tab, repeat what you just said and make sure it's what I expect!"},
  ],
});
```

After the simulated user returns all `fixed_responses`, it will generate responses via LLM using the system prompt and any externally facing messages (with role `role=user` or with `role=assistant` with no present tool calls) in the current trajectory. If you do not pass any `fixed_responses`, the prebuilt simulated user will generate an initial query based on the provided `system` prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> The prebuilt simulated user flips message roles when calling the underlying LLM - `user` messages become `assistant` messages and vice versa.

This prebuilt takes the following parameters:

- `system`: A string prompt that the simulator adds to the start of the current trajectory as a system message. We suggest having the LLM take on a role corresponding to a specific type of user persona you are testing for.
- `model`: A string matching the model name you are using. Has the same format as the LLM-as-judge evaluator param, and requires you to install the appropriate [LangChain integration package](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) if using models other than OpenAI. Must be populated if `client` is not populated.
- `client`: A LangChain chat model instance. Must be populated if `model` is not populated.
- `fixed_responses`: A list of hard-coded responses that will be returned in order. If the current conversation turn is greater than the number of responses in this array, the simulated user will generate a response via LLM.

### Custom simulated users

If you need other functionality beyond the prebuilt simulated user, you can create your own by wrapping it in a function with the correct signature:

```ts
import {
  runMultiturnSimulation,
  type ChatCompletionMessage
} from "openevals";

const myApp = async ({
  inputs,
  threadId
}: { inputs: ChatCompletionMessage, threadId: string }) => {
  const output = "3.11 is greater than 3.9.";
  return { role: "assistant", content: output, id: "1234" };
};

const mySimulatedUser = async ({ trajectory, turnCounter }: {
  trajectory: ChatCompletionMessage[];
  turnCounter: number;
}) => {
  const output = "Wow that's amazing!";
  return { role: "user", content: output, id: "5678" };
};

// Run the simulation directly with the customized user function
const simulatorResult = runMultiturnSimulation({
  app,
  user,
  trajectoryEvaluators: [],
  maxTurns: 1,
});
```

## Multiturn simulation with LangGraph

If your `app` (or simulated `user`) is built using LangGraph and relies on a [checkpointer for persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/), the provided `thread_id` param can be used to populate the field in `config.configurable`.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";

import {
  createLLMSimulatedUser,
  runMultiturnSimulation,
  createLLMAsJudge,
  type ChatCompletionMessage
} from "openevals";

const giveRefund = tool(
  async () => {
    return "Refunds are not permitted.";
  },
  {
    name: "give_refund",
    description: "Give a refund to the user.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);

// Create a React-style agent
const agent = createReactAgent({
  llm: await initChatModel("openai:gpt-5.4"),
  tools: [giveRefund],
  prompt:
    "You are an overworked customer service agent. If the user is rude, be polite only once, then be rude back and tell them to stop wasting your time.",
  checkpointer: new MemorySaver(),
});

const app = async ({
  inputs,
  threadId
}: { inputs: ChatCompletionMessage, threadId: string }) => {
  const res = await agent.invoke({
    messages: [inputs],
  }, {
    configurable: { thread_id: threadId },
  });
  return res.messages[res.messages.length - 1];
};

const user = createLLMSimulatedUser({
  system:
    "You are an angry user who is frustrated with the service and keeps making additional demands.",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const trajectoryEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
  prompt:
    "Based on the below conversation, has the user been satisfied?\n{outputs}",
  feedbackKey: "satisfaction",
});

const result = runMultiturnSimulation({
  app,
  user,
  trajectoryEvaluators: [trajectoryEvaluator],
  maxTurns: 5,
  threadId: "1",
});

console.log(result);
```

# LangSmith Integration

For tracking experiments over time, you can log evaluator results to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/), a platform for building production-grade LLM applications that includes tracing, evaluation, and experimentation tools.

LangSmith currently offers two ways to run evals: a [pytest](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/pytest) (Python) or [Vitest/Jest](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/vitest-jest) integration and the `evaluate` function. We'll give a quick example of how to run evals using both.

## Pytest or Vitest/Jest

First, follow [these instructions](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/pytest) to set up LangSmith's pytest runner,
or these to set up [Vitest or Jest](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/vitest-jest), setting appropriate environment variables:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key"
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
```

Then, set up a file named `test_correctness.eval.ts` with the following contents:

```ts
import * as ls from "langsmith/vitest";
// import * as ls from "langsmith/jest";

import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const correctnessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "correctness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

ls.describe("Correctness", () => {
  ls.test("incorrect answer", {
    inputs: {
      question: "How much has the price of doodads changed in the past year?"
    },
    referenceOutputs: {
      answer: "The price of doodads has decreased by 50% in the past year."
    }
  }, async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {
    const outputs = "Doodads have increased in price by 10% in the past year.";
    ls.logOutputs({ answer: outputs });

    const result = await correctnessEvaluator({
      inputs,
      outputs,
      referenceOutputs,
    });
    ls.logFeedback({ key: result.key, score: result.score });
  });
});
```
Note that when creating the evaluator, we've added a `feedbackKey` parameter. This will be used to name the feedback logged to LangSmith via `ls.logFeedback()`.

Now, run the eval with your runner of choice:

```bash
vitest run test_correctness.eval.ts
```

Feedback from the prebuilt evaluator will be automatically logged in LangSmith as a table of results like this in your terminal (if you've set up your reporter):

![Terminal results](/static/img/pytest_output.png)

And you should also see the results in the experiment view in LangSmith:

![LangSmith results](/static/img/langsmith_results.png)

## Evaluate

Alternatively, you can [create a dataset in LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/manage-datasets-in-application) and use your created evaluators with LangSmith's [`evaluate`](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/evaluate-llm-application) function:

```ts
import { evaluate } from "langsmith/evaluation";
import { createLLMAsJudge, CONCISENESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

const concisenessEvaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
  prompt: CONCISENESS_PROMPT,
  feedbackKey: "conciseness",
  model: "openai:gpt-5.4",
});

const wrappedConcisenessEvaluator = async (params: {
  inputs: Record<string, unknown>;
  outputs: Record<string, unknown>;
  // Unused for this evaluator
  referenceOutputs?: Record<string, unknown>;
}) => {
  const evaluatorResult = await concisenessEvaluator({
    inputs: params.inputs,
    outputs: params.outputs,
  });
  return evaluatorResult;
};

await evaluate(
  (inputs) => "What color is the sky?",
  {
    data: datasetName,
    evaluators: [wrappedConcisenessEvaluator],
  }
);
```

> [!TIP]
> In the above examples, we add wrapper functions around prebuilt evaluators for clarity since some evaluators may require parameters other than `inputs`, `outputs` and `reference_outputs`/`referenceOutputs`. However, if your evaluator accepts exactly those named parameters, you may pass them directly into the `evaluate` method.
